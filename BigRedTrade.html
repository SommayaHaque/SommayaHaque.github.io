        <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Working in a small group, we aimed to design a solution for students on Cornellâ€™s campus to facilitate buying and selling items
            <br> Our starting goal was simple: to understand the motivations, preferences, challenges, and needs of Cornell 
            students living off-campus regarding buying, selling, and exchanging items. <br>
            Next, we planned to use this information in hopes of designing a platform or solution that eases the process, reduces environmental waste and unnecessary expenditures.

            <p>For our data analysis, we started with an affinity diagram. Since we were a remote team, we chose to use Mural to help us gather insights. 
            Our original diagram was very large, after taking insights from over twelve interviews. 
            We ended up condensing it into five main categories, which later became our key insights. </p>

        <p> We created our persona based off the key insights of our affinity diagram. The goal was to make it someone who was a member of our target audience.

          <h3>Low Fidelity</h3>
          <p> We started off by independently creating out own low fidelity prototypes. 
            Mine was constructed from copy paper and vellum paper. 
            I hand-drew every screen and used vellum and dry-erase markers for user inputs. When it came to conducting a usability 
          test, I realized how difficult it would be create an app from scratch without any of the development tools and plugins I was used to.
        I started by identifying which tasks I needed my prototype to feature, and decided on the primary screens.
      Then I had to work out the flow and functionality between the primary screens, which meant more screens in between.
            Once I found a user, I acted as the "computer", changing the screens as they made their selections.
