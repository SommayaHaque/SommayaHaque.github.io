        <h3>Timeline:  September 2023 - November 2023 </h3>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Working in a small group, we aimed to design a solution for students on Cornellâ€™s campus to facilitate buying and selling items
            <br> Our starting goal was simple: to understand the motivations, preferences, challenges, and needs of Cornell 
            students living off-campus regarding buying, selling, and exchanging items. <br>
            Next, we planned to use this information in hopes of designing a platform or solution that eases the process, reduces environmental waste and unnecessary expenditures.

              <p>For our data analysis, we started with an affinity diagram. Since we were a remote team, we chose to use Mural to help us gather insights. 
              Our original diagram was very large, after taking insights from over twelve interviews. 
              We ended up condensing it into five main categories, which later became our key insights. </p>

          <h3>Low Fidelity</h3>
          <p> We started off by independently creating out own low fidelity prototypes. 
            Mine was constructed from copy paper and vellum paper. 
            I hand-drew every screen and used vellum and dry-erase markers for user inputs. When it came to conducting a usability 
          test, I realized how difficult it would be create an app from scratch without any of the development tools and plugins I was used to.
        I started by identifying which tasks I needed my prototype to feature, and decided on the primary screens.
      Then I had to work out the flow and functionality between the primary screens, which meant more screens in between.
            Once I found a user, I acted as the "computer", changing the screens as they made their selections.

            <h3>Trouble With Figma </h3>
            <p>We soon began working on digitalizing screens using Figma. <br>
              One of my tasks included creating a functioning keyboard, one that stored and reused user input when running a demo.
              I assumed I could save code by importing Scanner or something similar like in Java. <br>
              After looking through tutorials, I realized there was nothing like that in Figma and resorted to a mix of research and trial and error. 
              Through this process, I learned that variables in Figma are primarily for saving values across files for you to design with, not for saving data from a demo.
              <br>Since we were not allowed to use plug-ins or any pre-built keyboard components from online, 
              I ended up adding functionality to each square on the keyboard by manually allowing each key to append a letter to an empty string.
              The process was tedious but turned out to be fool-proof in comparison to keyboard components I had found online.

            <h3>A Couple Issues... </h3>
            <p>We soon began working on digitalizing screens using Figma for our medium fidelity prototype. <br>
              After another round of usability tests, we realized that this prototype was riddled with issues we had completely overlooked as designers. <br>
              There were countless violated heuristics, including cosmetic level issues like lack of consistency or lack of system visibility, 
              to catastrophic issues like lack of error recovery in certain areas. </p>

        <h3>High Fidelity</h3>
        <p> In our high-fidelity prototype, we made many improvements to the app's design and functionality.
          Initially, there were numerous issues when filtering and browsing, including cut-off screens at the notch, flawed filter systems, and an unresponsive search bar. These violated the visibility heuristic but thankfully these were very simple fixes. <br>
          As for more major issues such as a lack of error record, we incorporated screens that would ask for user confirmation when performing a function. And of course, if they want to undo an action they can with almost every action.
