        <h1>Cornell Grill Club</h1>
            <h3>Timeline:  April 2023 - May 2023 </h3>
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
              This website was our culiminating project for Design and Programming for the Web. We were tasked with creating a website for a client of our choice. 
              We started by creating a team contract, then designing and implementing a website tailored to meet the needs of Cornell Grill Club, our client. <br>
              Although the website is complete for now, I hope to work on it soon and improve it with my improved design knowledge. <br>
            </p>
        </p>
        
        <h2>Client Goals</h2>
        <p>Based on the client goals, we were able to identify three main goals we would work on.
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>Goal 1: Highlight Event Information</strong><br>

        The events will be clearly labeled and spaced out with the use of contrasting colors and bright colors.
        <br>

        Our Rationale: 
            We are thinking about including images that are connected to the activity to show what these events might look like. We will do this by creating a theme that. People are coming to the website to see when events might be happening and see if they can see things space out and with enough contrast they can feel more at ease using the site. We will use cool colors to get feelings of tranquility as well as make sure that the events are easy to read. Schedule constraints can cause stress and this will help reduce that.
        <br> 
        <br>
        <strong>Goal 2: Display and Contact Club Members</strong>

        <br>This can be achieved by putting images of the members with a brief name and bio.
        <br>

        Our Rationale: 
        Make sure that every name is legible and that the colors used can work with the theme of the page. (if bio were to be include it would be smaller than the name and big enough to read) The photo would go at the top and the bio would be below it, following a familiar layout that many websites have. By using a common design template, users will know how to navigate the site and not have to worry about learning a new site which means they won't get frustated in using our site.
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>Goal 3: Convey Club Mission</strong>

        <br>
        Our Rationale:
        The audience is coming here to learn more about what the club is, its values. Yes the club can exist but if there is nothing that shows what makes the club different then there really is no difference. This design will incorporate the use of warm colors that align with grilling and cooking that show that a knitted community is a vital thing for the club.

        <br>
        </p>

        <h2>Research</h2>
        <p>Since our client was a club at Cornell, we decided to look at the existing websites of other Cornell clubs to help us gather information.</p>


        <h2>Card Sorting</h2>
        <p>Based on the information we planned to incude, we were able to create two iterations of potential layouts.
        
        <strong>Iteration One:</strong>
        I sorted all aspects of the Cornell Grilling club by categories for the Homepage, Teampage, About page and Joining Page
        
        <div class = layouts>
          <img src="purple-moose-project-1/design-plan/it1a.png" alt = "iteration 1 part a">
          <img src="purple-moose-project-1/design-plan/it1b.png" alt = "iteration 1 part b">
          <img src="purple-moose-project-1/design-plan/it1c.png" alt = "iteration 1 part c">
          <img src="purple-moose-project-1/design-plan/it1d.png" alt = "iteration 1 part d">
        </div>
        <br>
        
        <p><strong>Iteration 2:</strong>
        In the previous iteration I sorted the FAQ , contact information, phone number and email along with elements you would expect to see in the homepage such as welcome message, and club mission/values. Dedicating a page the FAQ/contact information ,expressed in this iteration, allows visitors to find the information they need more quickly and efficiently. This makes the website more organized and easier to navigate for the user.

        <div class = layouts>
          <img src="purple-moose-project-1/design-plan/it2a.png" alt = "iteration 2 part a">
          <img src="purple-moose-project-1/design-plan/it2b.png" alt = "iteration 2 part b">
          <img src="purple-moose-project-1/design-plan/it2c.png" alt = "iteration 2 part c">
          <img src="purple-moose-project-1/design-plan/it2d.png" alt = "iteration 2 part d">
          <img src="purple-moose-project-1/design-plan/it2e.png" alt = "iteration 2 part e">
        </div>
        <br>

        <h2>Layout Exploration</h2>
        <p> 
          <div class = layouts>
            <img src="purple-moose-project-1/design-plan/layout_narrow.png" alt = "layout exploration for narrow screen">
            <img src="purple-moose-project-1/design-plan/layout_wide.png" alt = "layout exploration for wide screen">
           </div>         
          <p>The two images above are the sketches for the “About” page for mobile and desktop version. The wide version and narrow version both has the menu bar and image carousel which would be used as our interactivity elements. The wide version would have the navigation bar, and the narrow version would have the hamburger dropdown menu button that transforms the regular horizontal header navigation into a dropdown menu.
          <br>

          <h2>Final Layouts</h2>
          <br>
          <p><strong>Narrow (Mobile) Designs:</strong>

          <div class = layouts>
          <img src="purple-moose-project-1/design-plan/final_narrow_home.png" alt = "final design for narrow screen - Home">
          <img src="purple-moose-project-1/design-plan/final_narrow_about.png" alt = "final design for narrow screen - About">
          <img src="purple-moose-project-1/design-plan/final_narrow_members.png" alt = "final design for narrow screen - Members">
          <img src="purple-moose-project-1/design-plan/final_narrow_join.png" alt = "final design for narrow screen - Join">
          <img src="purple-moose-project-1/design-plan/final_narrow_FAQ.png" alt = "final design for narrow screen - FAQ">
        </div>
        The narrow (mobile) version design has the url tap on the buttom and has the hamburger dropdown menu that navigates to different pages. It also has the image carousel which provides multiple images with space efficiency. Annotations are included in the sketches.
        <br>
        <br>

        <strong>Wide (Desktop) Designs:</strong>
        <div class = layouts>
          <img src="purple-moose-project-1/design-plan/final_wide_home.png" alt = "final design for wide screen - Home">
          <img src="purple-moose-project-1/design-plan/final_wide_about.png" alt = "final design for wide screen - About">
          <img src="purple-moose-project-1/design-plan/final_wide_members.png" alt = "final design for wide screen - Members">
          <img src="purple-moose-project-1/design-plan/final_wide_join.png" alt = "final design for wide screen - Join">
          <img src="purple-moose-project-1/design-plan/final_wide_FAQ.png" alt = "final design for wide screen - FAQ">
        </div>
        <br>
        The wide (desktop) version design has the tap navigation bar that navigates to different pages. It includes the image carousel as well and annotation.</p>
        
        <h2>Client Feedback</h2>
        <p>We met with the president of Cornell Grill, who was acting on behalf of our client. He likes the design. He likes the idea of a photo slideshow, and really likes the FAQ page and the team page. He would also like us to add the external links for campus groups and groupme.</p>
        
        <h2>User Testing</h2>
        <p>Every member of our group conducted user tests to ensure the usability of our website.
          <br>
          Tasks: <br>
          1. Please try to describe what the third image of the image carousel looks like!
          <br>
          2. Try to find the club president's name.
          <br>
          3. Try finding the link for GroupMe used for joining.
          <br>

          After the user testing, we realized we needed to inlcude some revisions in our website. One big issue was how sparse the website was. All the pages were named well, we were just missing content that users expected to find. For example, many users noted the lack of contact information for eboard members. In addition, users said that the joining page had insufficient content, with no description of what the groupme qr code is even for. In addition, we are going to try to make the carasoaul more usable. One of the users complained that the buttons were nowhere near the images and the buttons moved around so that's another change we want to make.
        </p>

        <h2>Work In Progress</h2>
        <p>We ended up submitting the following website, prioritizing the rubric of the assignment over aesthetics. </p>
        <div class = layouts>
          <img src="purple-moose-project-1/design-plan/final_wide_home.png" alt = "final design for wide screen - Home">
          <img src="purple-moose-project-1/design-plan/final_wide_about.png" alt = "final design for wide screen - About">
          <img src="purple-moose-project-1/design-plan/final_wide_members.png" alt = "final design for wide screen - Members">
          <img src="purple-moose-project-1/design-plan/final_wide_join.png" alt = "final design for wide screen - Join">
          <img src="purple-moose-project-1/design-plan/final_wide_FAQ.png" alt = "final design for wide screen - FAQ">
        </div>

        <h2>Improvements For The Future</h2>
        <p> While we did well, I hope to continue working on this website independently!</p>
