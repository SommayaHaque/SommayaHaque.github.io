        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Let's get to know each other! <br>
        I am currently taking a data science course, along with a web design course! Outside of classes, I am an active member and photographer for Women in Computing at Cornell, where we celebrate the involvment of women in traditionally male-dominated fields.
        Outside of school, I am employed as a Java instructor for high schoolers and prepare students for computer science tournaments and the Advanced Placement Computer Science A exam. I love coding and I'm always working on something new! Check out my <a href="experience.html">experience</a> page to see some of my recent programs.<br>
        During my free time, I love baking. To the right are some of the yummy treats I have made this past year.<br></p>

    <h2>Why UX?</h2><br>
    <p>I've always been drawn to UX design because it perfectly blends my love for all things creative and technology. 
      Growing up, Iâ€™ve always loved creating things, whether it was knitting, crocheting, baking, pottery, or sketching- I was always trying to find new ways to express myself through creating. 
      As I grew older, I discovered the world of coding and fell in love with the way it allowed me to create in a completely different way.
      <br>
      UX design, for me, is an intersection where creativity meets functionality. It's like crafting an experience of your own to share with others, all while maintaining a seamless experience. 
      I hope that one day my work will connect me to my users and my designs will connect users to their needs as though it were second nature.
      <br>
      Ultimately, pursuing UX design allows me to merge my creative side with my love for code. It's a field that constantly challenges me to consider how humans think, and to work innovatively while considering the practical aspects of design. 
      That blend is what continues to drive my passion for UX design.
